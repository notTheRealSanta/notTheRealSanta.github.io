At the core of neural network, its just manipulation and operations on matrices.

The idea of artificial neural network was evolved from the actual neural network in nature.
A neuron receives a signal from another neuron and it propagates another signal to another neuron. This is the same in the artificial neuron.

### The breakdown
There are essentially three types of layers :
   -Input
   -Hidden
   -Output

Input and output type has only a single layer whereas hidden *can* have multiple layers.
