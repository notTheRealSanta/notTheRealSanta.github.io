- All of us-currently living are born to a world already entangled with money. So to understand money one needs to understand the history of money. Before the invention of money, barter system was **not** the main mode of exchange ([üîó](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_money[Non-monetary_exchange](<Non-monetary_exchange.md>))). 
- Barter existed only to trade with members of another tribe or someone who is occasionally met with. Most transactions used a form of mental ledger where one would keep track of the 'IOU'-[I owe you](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOU). A sort of a debt.
- Early [Homo Sapiens](<Homo Sapiens.md>) remembered the payments and receipt of the things exchanged and kept tallies of them, mostly in memory. As tribes began to grow as a result of efficient process in the early agrarian societies, a need for a universal ledger began to grow.
- ## IOU üßæ
    - The physical manifestation of IOU began as stone, shell, salt, tooth and so on. Creating a common medium of exchange meant anyone could trade with anyone else. 
    - When the IOU can be saved for a future purchase, debt is created. So money and debt were created at the same time.
    - As trading globalized, gold emerged as the universal ledger.
- ## Specialization ‚öíÔ∏è
    - Increase in use of money resulted in increase in trade which resulted in people specializing in areas of interest to the society. Only when the blacksmiths can rely on the farmers for trade for food can they focus on creating better tools.
- ## Corruption ü¶û
    - Historically, consolidation of power meant sovereigns set the value of currency leading to an unbalanced utility of money. Those with power exploited those without money. 
    - If centralized money was not invented ( i.e printing paper money or minting coins ) then there might not be money to wage wars.
- ## Gold Standard ‚ö±Ô∏è
    - For 5000 years gold fascinated humankind. It was because the scarcity of gold was universal that gave gold the property of storage of wealth. 
    - In 1971, the convertibility of US dollar to gold was [abolished](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_shock) giving rise to the [Free Floating Currencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_exchange_rate).
    - The only thing that keep the value of dollar and therefore of all currencies is mutual trust.
- ## Happiness üòÉ
    - Unable to see the economic output of money, humankind associated money to success. But the marginal return of utility of money diminishes.
    - Making money (which is the focus of people in a capitalist society) is like eating pancakes, the more you eat lesser the satisfaction you gain from it.

        - This is from a [study](https://spia.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/content/docs/news/Happiness_Money_Summary.pdf) by [Daniel Kahneman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman)
        - Take Home Message from the Study: High incomes don‚Äôt bring you happiness, but they do
bring you a life that you think is better.
- ## Rules to be Rich ü™ô
    - Save
        - While holding on to money would have been a safe strategy in the past, because of the [constant inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_inflation_rate) one needs to put the money to work to be able to save it.
        - Make money work for you, Invest.
            - Only invest in economic areas of your knowledge.
            - Invest to ensure future income not short term gains.
            - Avoid loss. Understand that in a free and open market the returns **always** correlate with risk.
        - Save as early as possible. [Compound interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_interest) is your friend.
    - Spend
        - Budget before spending but don't be a miser.
        - Do not increase spending with increase in your income.([üîó](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifestyle-inflation.asp))
- ## Return of the Ledger üßæ
    - The ledger makes a comeback in the form of crypto-currencies.
    - In terms of [qualities of money](https://www.stlouisfed.org/education/economic-lowdown-podcast-series/episode-9-functions-of-money), Bitcoin far exceeds gold and the current (centralized mess of a) currency system.
- ## Idea of Money üí∏
    - It is important to understand that the world changes because of people and not money. It also important to recognize that money enables a medium of trust. 
    - The foundation of money is not of greed and exploitation (although historically it has been) but the foundation of money is that of __sharing, trust and collaboration__. 
- **Money is more abstract than people think it is ( now more than ever ) while also being more important of a subject to understand than people think it‚Äôs ought to be.**
