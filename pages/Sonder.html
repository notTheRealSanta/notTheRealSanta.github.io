You see other people in this story, some close enough to call as friends and family, some acquaintances and some in the background: a random passerby. Each of them living a life as interesting and complex as yours. Each one of them holds thoughts that are not dissimilar to that of your own.  </p>
<p>Not only do the people living is the present who lives are as conscious as your life, all the people that lived before also lived a life with thoughts, ambitions, worries, mistakes and friends. Chrono-sonder.</p>
<p>Most people are stranger to you. Most stories you will never know. Cherish the once you do know: people and their stories.</p>
<p>Chrono-Sonder
<ul>
<li>Imagine what is like to live a life in the past. Only a few hundred years ago, the chances of you crossing the age of 15 was about 50% ( compared to about 5% now ). Our species has spent most time without electricity or running water. We collected firewood to cook food and constantly worried about our next meal. Our <em>geist</em> was a zero sum universe. We were at war and did not see another way.</li>
